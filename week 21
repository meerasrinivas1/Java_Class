1. 1.  Write a program that will take input for collecting student info and store in file.  Leave a blank line
    after each student. One detail in each line (Name, Gender, DOB, City).  End the program when Name is "-1"
    Note: Each time I run the program the previous data should still exist.
    
def collect_data():
    name = input("Enter name: ")
    if name == "-1":
        return None, None, None, None
    gender = input("Enter gender: ")
    dob = input("Enter dob: ")
    city = input("Enter city: ")
    return name, gender, dob, city
def write_data(name, gender, dob, city):
    path = 'data/student_info.txt'
    with open(path, 'a') as f:
        f.write(f'{name}\n{gender}\n{dob}\n{city}\n\n')

while True:
    name, gender,dob,city = collect_data()
    if name is None:
        break
    else:
        write_data(name,gender,dob,city)
        
2. Write a program to collect Student names and their marks in 5 subjects (English, Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
    Marks will be entered in comma separated format. Leave blank line after each student  
    
def collect_data2():
    name = input("Enter Name: ")
    marks= input("Enter marks in 5 subjects (English, Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology))")
    return name, marks
def write_data2(name, marks):
    path = 'data/student_marks.txt'
    with open(path, 'a') as f:
        f.write(f'{name}\n{marks}\n\n')

while True:
    name, marks=collect_data2()
    write_data2(name,marks)
