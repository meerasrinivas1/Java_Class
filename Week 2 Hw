5.  Here is my first Java program.  Let me know if this will compile?  If yes, what will be the
    output.  If No, first make only the changes that will allow the program to compile.  Next once it compiles
    can I run it.  If yes, what is the output? If No, what should I change to get the output in the print
    statements.
    package com.ragu;
    public class myclass;
    {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    float My_float = 10.2;
    char C = "A";
    System.out.println(C);
    System.out.println(My_float);
    }
    }  
    Note: Do not copy this in IJ to test.  Find the output without any help and make corrections without
    using the IJ editor.
    
    Answer: No this will not compile. 
    package com.ragu;
    public class myclass;
    {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    float My_float = 10.2F;
    char C = 'A';
    System.out.println(C);
    System.out.println(My_float);
    }
    }
